  This repository contains an Arduino program to control a pH dipping robotic arm. The arm will repeteadedly    raise and lower a pH sensitive ISFET, temperature probe, reference electrode, and standardized lab grade p    H probe into beakers containing solutions of varying pH or temperature.
   
  Pinout:
   
          Pin 8  = Switch 1 (move servo to (0, 30) from initial position
          Pin 9  = Switch 2 (begin testing sequence)
          Pin 10 = Switch 3 (return servo to (0, 30) from anywhere)
          Pin 11 = Switch 4 (return servo to (0,0))
